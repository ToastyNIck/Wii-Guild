#### cIOS Installation
cIOS is used for USB Loaders to play backups. Fair Warning cIOS is still in the experimental stage.
{: .notice--info}
This version of cIOS is only for the Wii Mini
{: .notice--info}

1. Download the cIOS File [d2x-cios-installer-Wii Mini.zip](/assets/files/d2x-cios-installer-Wii Mini.zip)
1. Open the archive and drag and drop the only folder to the "apps" folder on your USB Drive 
1. Open the Homebrew Channel on your Wii Mini
1. Launch the d2x cIOS installer
1. First you gotta select which cIOS to install. in "Select cIOS", Change the value to "d2xl-v1-beta2"
1. Now Go to "Select cIOS base" and change the value to "57"
1. Now Go to "Slect cIOS slot" and change the value to "249"
      Under "NOTES" there will be a section "Offline installation". Take a note of the exact version number (5 digits directly before the ".wad" extension).
1. Press A to start the installation.
       If it fails with a weird "tmd version mismatch" error, that isn't a problem. Just try again, but this time, while selecting the cIOS base, press left/right on the wiimote until the 5-digit number from earlier is different than when you tried before. This time, it should work - one of the two version numbers should definitely work.
1. After successfully installing the cIOS press B to exit. Now you have cIOS installed.
